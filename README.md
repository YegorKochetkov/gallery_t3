# Gallery T3

A very basic gallery made to familiarize users with the functionality of services like PostHog, Uploadthing, Upstash, Sentry, Clerk, and T3.

**Uploading images to the gallery is limited**. To see how the application works in the full version, you can watch a [demo video](https://youtu.be/1dlU9oMQjz0) or you can clone the repository and configure all the necessary services yourself: database, PostHog, Uploadthing, Upstash, Sentry, Clerk.
